## RLHF has become a cornerstone technique for fine-tuning LLMs, enabling them to align with human preferences. At its core, RLHF leverages a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, where an agent learns to make sequential decisions based on rewards.

## In this code, weâ€™ll walk through a simple implementation of an RLHF system using Python and PyTorch. This toy example models sentence generation as an MDP, training a policy to produce positive-sounding sentences.

For documentation of the code :
1. Read the code, dodo :p
